Module 10 challenge

The Climate Analysis and Flask API project uses Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to analyze a climate database and provide a web API. The project includes climate data analysis, station analysis, and a Flask API that provides endpoints for precipitation data, station data, temperature observations for the previous year, and minimum, average, and maximum temperature for a given start or start-end range. To use the project, clone the repository, install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, and run the Flask app with python app.py.
